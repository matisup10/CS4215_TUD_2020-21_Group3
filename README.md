`getwordocc.py` builds the index of the most occurring words of the IMDB plaintext movie reviews.

`visualizeOcc.py` generates the graphs related to word index which are used in the report.

`graphs.py, graphs2.py, graphs3.py` generate graphs based on results.csv and the data2 folder, which are used in the paper.

`sentiment.py` is the script which was deployed and used on a server of Google Cloud Platform to conduct our experiments.

`run-sentiments.sh` is used on the cloud server to run repetitions of `sentiment.py`
